# Introduction
This is a construction experiment project led by the CE<sup>3</sup> Laboratory. The project involves:

1. Investigated the physical properties of a fast-growing poplar wood as a building material.
2. Using this fast-growing poplar wood as the primary building material, designed an experimental wooden architectural structure and conducted 3D modeling of the design.
3. Leading a team to build a small experimental building to validate the rationality of the design and the durability of the structure.
4. Gathered student evaluations of this architectural design.

**Post-project follow-up**: The stability and durability of the experimental wooden structure exceeded expectations. Over a one-year lifecycle, the structure withstood various weather conditions, including typhoons, heavy rain, and substantial snowfall, displaying no significant damage.
