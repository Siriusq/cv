# Introduction
This project, supported by the Dam-Lab Digital Processing Center's Laser Processing Laboratory, aims to explore how digital techniques can enhance the construction of landscape walls. The project involves:

1. Utilizing Rhino modeling software and Grasshopper graphical programming plugin to design and 3D model digital landscape walls.
2. Based on the 3D wall model, creating laser processing template files. With the assistance of the laser processing laboratory, using a laser cutting device to produce auxiliary positioning templates required for wall construction.
3. Leading a team to build a section of a demonstrative landscape wall with the assistance of the laser-cut positioning templates.
