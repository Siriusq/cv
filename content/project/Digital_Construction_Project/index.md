# Introduction
This project, led by the Dam-Lab Digital Processing Center, aims to explore how digital techniques can enhance the construction of landscape walls.

- Developed a parametric modeling workflow for generating a wave-form landscape wall system with controlled geometric variation.
- Utilized the parametric 3D models to simulate and compare two digital fabrication strategies: direct robotic arm construction versus laser-cut template-assisted positioning, focusing on constructability and geometric accuracy.
- Led a 12-member student team to fabricate a wave-form landscape wall segment using the laser-cut template-assisted construction method.
- Analyzed the role and limitations of digital construction aids in aligning virtual geometry with physical assembly.
- **Tools**: Rhinoceros 3D, Grasshopper, Autodesk AutoCAD
