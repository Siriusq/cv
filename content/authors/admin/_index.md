I am a developer with a primary focus on C# and Unity technologies. 

Currently, I am actively engaged in learning augmented reality development, while also seeking a Ph.D. position in the field of extended reality (XR). My research interests encompass extended reality, human-computer interaction, and game development. 

Additionally, I am passionate about contributing to open-source projects and maintaining computers as a hobby.
