I am a software developer specializing in C# and Flutter. 

My primary focus is on extended reality (XR), and I'm actively expanding my expertise in this field while seeking a Ph.D. position. My research interests include XR, human-computer interaction (HCI), and game development. 

Outside of my professional work, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and maintaining computer hardware.
